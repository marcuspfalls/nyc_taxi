These percentages are usually a multiple of 5, and from the line of best fit (orange) and the frequency of points, we can conclude that the mean and the most common percentage is 20%. \n\nThe other trend, noted by the horizontal lines on the first plot, show that a certain number of passengers pay to the nearest dollar. The quantity varies somewhat depending on the total amount, but 3 USD is the most common tip. \n\nBy analysing the lines of best fit in both plots, we can see that there are many more who tip a percentage rather than to the nearest dollar. Although not included here, I also tested the tips based on other factors, such as passenger count and location (no significant trend) and fare amount (similar to total amount minus tip, but the lines at 20% were not as well defined).\n\nGiven this analysis, I would conclude that the most reliable (and rather simple) model to predict a tip would be 20 % of the total amount charged before tip. The mathematical expression is below. \n\n`predicted_tip = (fare_amount + extra + mta_tax + tolls_amount + imp_surcharge)/5`\n\nIt is worth mentioning, however, that this model was made using only data that paid by card and that we shouldn't expect to see a similar trend with tipping with cash.
